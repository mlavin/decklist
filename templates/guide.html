            <h2>Card and Deck Guide</h2>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Decks for the Pokémon Trading Card Game are made of 60 cards in total. These cards
            are a mixture of different types of cards including Pokémon, Trainer (Supporter, Item,
            Tool, Stadium), and Energy cards. Roughly these break down into 12-20 Pokémon,
            25-35 Trainers, and 8-15 Energy. These ranges vary depending on the overall strategy
            of the deck and some decks may require cards outside of these general ranges. It should
            be noted that other than basic energy, you cannot have more than four of the same card
            with the same name in a deck.</p>

            <h3>Formats</h3>
            <p>Competitive Pokémon play is broken into two formats which dictate the set of
            cards which are allowable for play. These formats are Standard which includes
            the cards from Primal Clash (released Feb 2015) through the Sun and Moon base set
            (released Feb 2017) and Expanded which includes the cards from the Black and White
            base set (released April 2011) through the Sun and Moon base set (released Feb 2017).
            These formats rotate each September, dropping 3-5 of the oldest sets.
            Cards from older sets which have since been reprinted in legal set are still legal
            for play in that format as long as the wording on the card has not changed.</p>

            <p>For example, the popular supporter N has been reprinted a number of times. While
            the original sets Noble Victories (released Nov 2011) and Dark Explorers (released May 2012)
            are no longer legal in Standard play, you can play those prints of N because they
            have the same wording at N when it was reprinted in Fates Collide (released May 2016)
            which is still legal in Standard.<p>

            <p>For casual play, you may not care about whether cards are legal for tournament play,
            but it's worth keeping in mind that these cards are printed together and rotated to balance the
            game. It's also worth knowing that there might be other prints of the same card which
            could be cheaper or easier to find. This guide is written using examples from the
            Standard format but the principles apply to all formats. With larger formats such as
            Expanded there are more cards to choose from and more options for filling the roles
            needed to build a balanced and consitent deck.</p>

            <h3>Deck Strategy and Consistency</h3>
            <p>Decks are built around a particular strategy (or strategies) which will allow the
            player to win the game whether that is by taking their six prizes first or by discarding
            all of their oppenent's cards so that they cannot continue the game. Some decks do this
            through big, aggressive attacks which knock out most other Pokémon in a single hit. Other
            decks plan to consistently hit for two-hit knockouts. Some decks try to stop opponent's
            attacks from dealing much sometimes even any damage. Others try to deny their opponent
            any energy so they simply cannot attack. Whatever it is, a deck should have a clear
            strategy and the cards included in the deck should work to compliment that goal.
            Any card game involves a bit of randomness so decks are called consstent when they
            can effectively work towards their strategy regardless of the randomness of the
            draw.</p>

            <h2>Cards Roles</h2>

            <h3>Attackers</h3>
            <p>Attacking with your Pokémon to knock out your opponent's Pokémon to take your
            six prizes is the most common way to win the game so it shouldn't be surprising
            that most decks are built around a single attacking Pokémon or a few complimentary
            Pokémon. Once you've identified a primary and secondary attacker in your deck,
            you can build the rest of your deck around supporting getting those Pokémon ready
            to attack. The types of cards you'll need with depend on the amount and type
            of energy required, the evolution stage of your attackers (basic, stage 1, stage 2,
            BREAK, Mega).</p>
